  "notes": "Joker offers an assortment of sillyness to brighten your day: jokes, trivial, rolls, custom ready check, and more. It's been around since 2019, and the addon is fully open-source. Everything works as describes, with no noted flags. Disclaimer: The creator of Andy is also the creator of Joker, so there's a bit of a conflict of interest here - if someone else would like to independently audit Joker, please feel free!",
